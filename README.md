# coding-challenges
A collection of my submissions to online coding challenges.

## Folder Descriptions
**design-to-code:** I take an image of a UI design mockup, and turn it into a webpage. I try to stay faithful to the original design, though I may deviate where the design could be improved, or where I am unable to locate an asset that was used. Design prompts come from iCodeThis' "Design to Code" challenge mode.
- Inside the `readme.md` of each submission folder, there is a clickable preview of the submission as well as a credit to the original designer.
